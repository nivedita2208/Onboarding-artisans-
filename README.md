Ideation – India has a wide array of art forms that are used to communicate mythological stories, traditions, and culture. There are many art forms that help the viewer understand the country’s heritage.
Each of these art forms has its own significance be it, patterns styles, or the stories they tell. Local communities, tribes, and other project groups have been trying to make sure that these art forms are being passed down generations and help keep the art alive.

For Example – Madhubani Paintings – Vibrant paintings that use mineral pigments. Pattachitra Paintings – simple paintings that focus on mythological storytelling.

We believe that digitization of these art forms in the form of NFTs is a great way to archive as well as create awareness about them.

My teammate and I have had the opportunity to explore traditional art first-hand and learn about the artisanal communities behind them. We believe that the preservation of these communities should be prioritized.

We want to be the ones to offer our help to various artisans from India to take ownership of their art in the web3 community. Helping them adapt to these new opportunities can help in monetizing their work and find users worldwide who appreciate their art.

We intend to onboard artisans renowned for their traditional Indian art forms onto a mintbase platform.
We help organize and create a community that appreciates their art.
Help set up NEAR wallets, create NFTs.
Although the focus right now is on the various painting techniques in India, this project could also cover other folk art, dances, and cinema.
Idea Execution stages -

Work with artisans to get them onboard onto the marketplace.

Facilitate the transaction between the artisans and the buyers.
